            <h1 class="text-center">Origin of the word Uzbek</h1>
            <p>There are several hypotheses about the origin of the Uzbek ethnonym. The first mention of the Uzbek word as a personal name dates back to the XII century. The word Uzbek originated among the Turkic tribes in Movarounnahr before the arrival of the Mongols in the 13th century. The 12th-century Arab historian Osama ibn Munqiz, in his Book of Enlightenment, states that one of the leaders of the Seljuk period (1115-1116) was the ruler of Mosul, Emir Uzbek. According to the historian Rashid al-Din, the last representative of the Ildegiz dynasty who ruled in Tabriz was Uzbek Muzaffar (1210-1225) [7]. [8] Historian Mutal Irmatov suggested that the Uzbek word comes from the name "Ozlar" [9] Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professor R. G. Mukminova provided additional evidence against linking the ethnic name of the Uzbeks with the name of the Uzbek khan. Sharofiddin Ali Yazdi reports on the events of 1289, long before the reign of the Uzbek khan, and mentions the raid of Uzbek troops in Tabriz. [10] According to other historians, in the 1960s, a union of nomadic Turkic tribes called Uzbeks was formed in the Dashti-Kipchak region. In the 1960s, the ethnonym "Uzbek" became the collective name of the entire Turkic population of eastern Dashti-Kipchak. The ethnonym "Uzbek" came to Movarounnahr during the reign of Amir Temur. The great poet Alisher Navoi (1441-1501) mentioned the ethnonym "Uzbek" in Khorasan and Movarounnahr.</p>
